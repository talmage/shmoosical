Music for FlipperZero.

This repository exists because of the Security Theater Challenge at [Shmoocon](https://shmoocon.org/) 2023.  The theme was *Theater* and two of the puzzles in the Security Theater Challenge were sheet music.

The first and currently only entry in this repository is a transcription of one of the sheets, 
*Shmoosical Overture*, for the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) music player.
